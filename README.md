# Maxsum-of-SubMatrices-of-M-X-and-my-solution
My code solves the following algorithm:

Given a m x n grid filled with integers, find the submatrix with maximum sum among all submatrices.

Example:

Input:
[
  [ 1,  -9, -10,  1],
  [-1,  10,  10,  1],
  [ 0,   9,   9, -9],
  [-1,  -1,  -1, -1]
]
Output: 38
Explanation: Submatrix [[10, 10], [9, 9]]
